Basically a slightly downgraded fork of the [original WorldGuessr](https://github.com/codergautam/worldguessr) I made for myself, because I hate what worldguessr has become. All online stuff is removed, only singleplayer and only selfhost ðŸ™‚


The key differences there are; 
1. Version of May 4th 2024 was taken as a base
2. No leaderboard
3. No multiplayer

### Original WorldGuessr can be found [here](https://worldguessr.com)
### Github repo of WorldGuessr can be found [here](https://github.com/codergautam/worldguessr)
